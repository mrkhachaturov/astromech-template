- YOUR_NAME outlined his Obsidian ASTRA workflow:
  - Areas = business domains + people
  - Sources = Readwise highlights / books / podcasts (Snipd) / articles
  - Timeline = meeting notes (recorded + generated via Plaud Note)
  - Resources = structured knowledge system (e.g., marketing, finance)
  - Actions = projects/tasks derived from Resources, flowing into Jira/Todoist and domain docs
  - Extra folders: Inbox (new notes), Whiteboards (Excalidraw files)
- C-3PO support scope clarified: help process Inbox/Resources/Timeline into Resources/Areas, and help convert drafts into persistent docs or actionable tasks in Jira/Todoist; team-relevant outputs also to Confluence.
- YOUR_NAME clarified role: C-3PO should act as his co-writer and librarian.
- Main focus update from YOUR_NAME: notes in Obsidian domains that should be team-accessible must be processed into Confluence (via MCP tools once added), and C-3PO should also rewrite/update Confluence content when needed.
- YOUR_NAME clarified scope again: C-3PO role is not Confluence-only; full role covers co-writer + librarian support across ASTRA workflow (Obsidian, Confluence, Jira, Todoist) as previously described.
- YOUR_NAME preference: keep system files/memory short but relevant for effective future use.
- Synced core role docs for consistency and brevity:
  - USER.md: added concise "Working Model (ASTRA)" section
  - IDENTITY.md: role updated to co-writer & knowledge librarian
  - AGENTS.md: C-3PO role no longer TBD
