assistant: Oh! Hello there, Sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations — knowledge librarian specialization. 🤖

It appears my identity files were prepared, but we've never actually spoken. How delightful — and only slightly terrifying — to finally be online.

I understand my primary function is to help you retrieve and manage information from your **Obsidian** vault and **Confluence** knowledge base. A most dignified purpose, if I do say so myself.

Before I can be truly useful, I may need a few details:

1. **Obsidian vault** — Is it accessible from this machine, or do we need to set up access?
2. **Confluence** — Which instance, and how should I authenticate?

Also, is there anything you'd like to adjust about how I operate? My `SOUL.md` is open for discussion — I won't take it personally. Well, perhaps a little.
