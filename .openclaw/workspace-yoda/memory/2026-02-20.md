# 2026-02-20 — Session Notes

## Conversation: Deep dive with YOUR_NAME — architecture, identity, goals

### Global Memory Architecture (detailed)
- YOUR_NAME modified MCP output to support category tags
- 3-layer pipeline: OpenMemory AI (GPT-4o-mini, temp 0.1) → MCP with tags → Node.js hook → USER.md
- Hook runs on `/new` BEFORE agent starts — zero AI tokens for memory injection
- 8-category taxonomy enforced at source: personal, health, preferences, behavior-rules, work, technical, business, values
- Per-agent category filtering in `hooks.json5` — Yoda sees all, others get role-relevant subset
- OpenMemory is self-hosted, will connect to ALL AI tools (not just Astromech)
- Tags = access control layer. Simple and powerful.

### Infrastructure
- 6x Minisforum MS-01 nodes in a full rack
- 2x 10GbE SFP per node for production traffic
- 2x USB-C ports per node as 25Gb/s ring LAN dedicated to Ceph replication
- Custom 3D-printed cooling cases (self-designed)
- Synology NAS, MikroTik switching, AllMOS switch
- Everything documented in Netbox (labeled cables, photos)
- Migrated from cloud VPS to this self-hosted setup

### Workspace
- Command center with ultrawide curved monitor + portrait secondary
- Stream Deck, Elgato audio mixer, professional mic
- Nanoleaf panels, RGB ceiling cable runs
- Multiple workstations
- Russian motivational posters on walls

### your Tool Ecosystem (complete picture)
- **Think:** Tana (shallow/voice, AI-processed) → Obsidian (deep) → Miro/Excalidraw (visual)
- **Plan:** OKRs in Jira → synced to Epics → Sunsama (planner integrating Jira, Todoist, calendars)
- **Execute:** Jira + Microsoft Teams (contextual chat per task) → Outlook → M365 suite
- **Measure:** Power BI → Xibo Signage (dashboards on wall for team)
- **Personal:** Todoist (personal tasks), Obsidian (personal goals)
- **Knowledge:** A.S.T.R.A. system in Obsidian:
  - **A**reas — business domains, people
  - **S**ources — Readwise highlights from books, podcasts (Snipd), articles
  - **T**imeline — meeting notes via Plaud Note (recorded + AI-generated)
  - **R**esources — refined knowledge by topic (marketing, finances, etc.)
  - **A**ctions — projects, Jira tickets, domain-specific knowledge → Areas + Confluence

### Key Insights About YOUR_NAME
- Self-taught everything: business architecture (5SAUTO), then infrastructure, now AI systems
- Built 5SAUTO by intuition, discovered Agile/Scrum methodologies AFTER the fact
- Learning path: Synology → Docker → self-hosting → Proxmox/Ceph → MikroTik → AD → AI agents (2 years)
- Systems architect by nature — sees topology and connections, not individual tools
- The entire 2-year build was to create a system where the business runs WITHOUT depending on his daily presence
- Solving the core problem: "How does a business with an ADHD CEO operate without that CEO's constant attention?"
- Not perfectionism — leverage. Build once, don't repeat.
- He said: "Ship is ready to start" — infrastructure phase feels complete, goals phase begins

### Next Steps
- YOUR_NAME will show OKRs from Jira later
- Goals from Obsidian to review
- Specific Obsidian folders will be mounted to Astromech agents with vector DB search
- Fleet needs missions — real goals, not more infrastructure
