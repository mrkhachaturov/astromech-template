- First real session as Yoda. All systems operational.
- **Drain test successful:** Inter-agent communication working. Yoda → L3-37 (sub-agent) → Whoop skill → wellness data back to YOUR_NAME. Full chain verified.
- L3-37 has custom Whoop skill (`whoop-up` npm package) — YOUR_NAME built it himself today.
- **Astromech backstory:** YOUR_NAME discovered OpenClaw from a YouTube video while in Egypt. Project has ~200k GitHub stars, tons of features. He spent ~1 week sleeping 4-5 hours configuring everything. 11 agents, complex config — not plug-and-play at all.
- My role: orchestrator. Talk to business-oriented agents, delegate, synthesize. Jedi Master over the droid fleet.
- Whoop data explains the bad sleep numbers — it was the build sprint, not neglect.
